Part 1:

- Each line is called a "report"
- Each report contains a list of numbers called "levels" separated by spaces
- A report is safe if:
  - The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing
  - Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three
- Iterate each line, execute is_safe
- If is_safe, increment a counter
- Return the counter

Part 2:

- Tolerate a single bad level
- Add a bad_index. If set, ignore that index
- If bad_index is already set, return false
