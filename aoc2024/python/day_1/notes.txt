Part 1:

location ID, a unique number.
lists compared side by side
list compared smallest to highest.

1. Need to sort each list
2. Compare how far apart each item is, abs(x-y)
3. Sum all all differences.

Sum(i=0 to n) of abs(x[i]-y[i]) where n is the total array size, x is array one and y is array two.


Part 2:

1. Create a dictionary of the left list as the keys, setting the values to 0.
2. Loop through the second list, incrementing the value of the key in the dictionary.
3. for each item multiply it by its value in the dictionary and then summation of all the values.
